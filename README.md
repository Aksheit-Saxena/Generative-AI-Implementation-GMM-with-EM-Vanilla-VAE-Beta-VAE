# Generative-AI-Implementation-GMM-with-EM-Vanilla-VAE-Beta-VAE

What are the problems the code solves?

1. Construct a GMM by implementing the EM algorithm, on all the images in the dataset, by downsizing the data to 28 by 28 pixels. Assume Diagonal Covariance. Plot the likelihood curve as the EM iteration progresses. Post training, Generate and plot 100 images in a grid of 10 by 10 with all three GMMs separately and record your observations.

2. Implement a vanilla VAE with MSE for conditional likelihood. Plot 10 by 10 grids of both reconstructions and generations. Plot the loss curves for likelihood, KL, and the combined terms.

3. Implement a beta-VAE with 4 different values of beta and plot 10 by 10 grids of generated and reconstructed data. Document your observation in terms of change in results with varying beta.

Due to the large size of the code, it could not be added to the repo due to size restrictions. I have made the link available for the entire working code.Complete details of the code along with the results can be found in the jupyter notebook.
